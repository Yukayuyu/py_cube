#-----------miscs----------
This programme will be temporarily marked as finished. I will add no more further functionality to it, due to the clumsy nature of its huge dependies (hard to package).
Any further implementation will be done somedays in the future when I rewrite this in JS. 

#-------------Usage------------------

Run the script "main.py".

Press key l, r, u, d, f, b to rotate 90 degree clockwise, 
or L R U D F B to rotate counter-clockwise.
Press 0 to switch between window and fullscreen.
Mouse Click and drag to adjust the viewing angle.

#----------Dependencies---------------

The source code depends on:
1. python 3.8.1
2. Standard 64 bits OpenGL library.
3. pygame 1.9.6
Or follow the pygame&OpenGL setup instructions.

##==================Dev_History===========================

Feb 19th
main program complete. 

#Feb 18th
Press r to rotate the R 90 degree. with animation.
(basic strucure is 80% complete)

#Feb 17th
a basic half rotation without animation

#Feb 16th
the whole structure of the cube is complete. 
consist of 26 individual cubies.

#Feb 9th
completed the GLcubies.py, which output a colored rotating 3D cubie using OpenGL and Pygame library.

#Feb 2nd
just completed the quaternion.py. It's tested and shall be fine.
move on to the cubie part.
